Answers to Ipython answers:


1) importing os and then using the command: ? os.path.abspath we can tell that the function is defined here: /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py


2) using the following command, we can tell that there are 233 files in the /etc folder:
num = !ls -l /etc |wc -l


3) to take the square root of num I imported numpy and also changed the type of num from a single value list to an int. (num2 = int(num[0])).
the squared value in 54289.

4)using the %timeit command several times for each of the operations we observe that the operation x*x is the fastest (~ 53 ns), after that is x**2 (~74 ns) and slowest is numpy.square(x) (~1.58 ms)

5) using %lsmagic. and then copying the answers and using grep on the results I got that there are 24 cell magic cell commands.
